1. Load one stack of images and transpose the dimension of x and y
   
   for k=1:frs
   im(:,:,k)=imread(strcat(filestem,num2str(i,'%02.0f'),'.tif'),k);
   end
   im=permute(im, [2,1,3]);
   filestem should be a string, which provide the path and file root for the image file. 
2. Run "bpass3dMB" to filter the transposed stack of images. The reason for running 
   "bpass3dMB" is explained in "feature3dMB". 
   res=bpass3dMB(im, lnoise, lobject,inputv ,varargin)
   lnoise=[1 1 lobject(3)/lobject(1)]; lobject is the size for setting the mimimum separation between features, 
which is a 3-vector; inputv is to indicate whether there is input for noclip or nopad and if no inputs for both,
inputv can be set as [0 0] 

3. Run "feature3dMB" 
   r=feature3dMB(res, diameter,masksz, xyzmax,inputv, sep, masscut, threshold)
   Diameter is the same parameter as lobject; masksz is the size of mask, which is a 3-vector; xyzmax is the size of
the 3D images [nx, ny, nz]; inputv indicates whether we have inputs for sep, masscut, threshold. Whether there is inputs for them is indicated in the logical input for inputv. Inputv contains 3 logical input. For example [0,1,0] 
indicates we have an input for masscut.
